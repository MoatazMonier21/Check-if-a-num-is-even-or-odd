# Check-if-a-num-is-even-or-odd
This project is to check if a number is even or odd. I used two functions and a procedure and an enum. 
the enum has two values odd = 1 and even = 2
the first function is to read the number from the console and return it
the second is to check if its modulus with 2 is 0 or another number
if it is 0 it returns the enum'value even
else it returns odd
the procedure is to check the value returned from the last function and prints the result odd or even
